      <h3 className='theme-color'>The Problem with Logistics</h3>
      <p>Sending parcels from point A to point B is done by
        centralized logistics providers like DHL, UPS or
        even government run services like USPS.
          <br /> <br />
        Transporting an item internationally will require
        you to fill in some tedious paper-work and definitely
        pay some pocket-itching bucks. Your friend on the other
        end will also probably wait for about 30 days before
         receiving the parcel you sent through. The same goes
         for e-commerce logistics and other supply chain related
          businesses.
